# **Project: Recipes**

### **Foundations Course**

*In this lesson I was tasked with fleshing out a simple recipe site. The project consists of an index page and three recipe pages. The lessons that I learned about in this project were:*

- Boilerplate HTML structure
- Adding images, using alt text, and adding dimensions to the image for clarity.
- Adding relative links to the index page that point to the recipe pages.
- Creating ordered and unordered lists.
- Incorporating headings and paragraphs for readability.
